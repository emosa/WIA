		<h1>Clipping Paths</h1>
		<p>Clipping paths restrict drawing to a particular area of the canvas. Think of clipping paths as masks - 
        areas where the mask is empty show through, while areas where the mask is opaque do not.</p>
        <p>Any path can be a clipping path. You simply draw the path as normal and then call the context's clip() 
        function to create one.</p>
